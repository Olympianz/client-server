#Server code is running on the individual robot machine

Add some instructions on how to start up robots in the lab:
1.  Start robot physically, power then server
2.  On client side, run ssh bot@10.10.3.111 (last 3 digits are robot's ID)
     - Enter files in robot, start client-server there
3.  Run sudo halt to stop robot (key: visionrobot)
